First thing I did was compare this code to the completed Run Buddy project made.

From there I saw that the original html had a lot of div produced and was not properly accessible for search functionality, etc. 

I also included some labeling so we can easily make out what is doing what in the code. 

I updated the div contatiner holding the name of the company and the links, (updated the anchors to link down to corresponding sections), and labeled the container with the listed links.

h2 was updated to it's own section so we could delete all of the specific h2s
